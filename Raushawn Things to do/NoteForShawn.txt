the components that u see in here is from react and the pages ur supposed to make,
your job is to convert them to typescript using [fileName].tsx 

put them in their respective folders. The typical structure wud be to
create a page.tsx file in the app folder(nest folders if needed) and
then create a component folder and file for that component. For example,
if u are working on the about us page, create a folder(already created) like this

- app (already created)
  - about (already created)
   -page.tsx (already created)

In the page.tsx file, name the function AboutUsPage()

create another folder in the root directory(nextjs folder)

- components(already created)
  - about
   - aboutUSComponent.tsx 

in the aboutUsComponent name the function AboutUsComponent()

After setting this up, navigate to your AboutUsPage() and import the aboutUsComponent.tsx(watch my jobs/page.tsx to see an example)

the reason for this is so that when nextjs renders the page it will render it first as a 
server componet which is faster than a client component, also note that in the 
component folder, most times u will have to type
'use client' above the file if u are using useState, useEffect and any other Hooks.

If anything is confusing u let me know
